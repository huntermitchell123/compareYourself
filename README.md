**Compare Yourself**

Ever wondered what dog most resembles you? Now you can know! I made a program that goes through google images based on a search input (dog, cat, etc.), and shows the one that looks most structurally similar to you (or any other input image). Note: you must have a couple packages installed for this to work, and also a chromedriver executable downloaded.

# Notes

- Only compatible w/ Python3
- Packages Required are in requirements.txt
- Must have a chromedriver compatible with your chrome version downloaded -> https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
